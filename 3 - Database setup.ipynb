    "__Setup DATABASE__\n",
    "\n",
    "- Now, open up mysite/settings.py. It’s a normal Python module with module-level variables representing Django settings.\n",
    " - By default, the configuration uses SQLite. If you’re new to databases, or you’re just interested in trying Django, this is the easiest choice. SQLite is included in Python, so you won’t need to install anything else to support your database. When starting your first real project, however, you may want to use a more scalable database like PostgreSQL, to avoid database-switching headaches down the road.\n",
    " - If you wish to use another database, install the appropriate database bindings and change the following keys in the DATABASES 'default' item to match your database connection settings:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - __ENGINE__ – Either 'django.db.backends.sqlite3', 'django.db.backends.postgresql', 'django.db.backends.mysql', or 'django.db.backends.oracle'. Other backends are also available.\n",
    "     - ![settings for DB1](pics/44.jpg)\n",
    "   - __NAME__ – The name of your database. If you’re using SQLite, the database will be a file on your computer; in that case, NAME should be the full absolute path, including filename, of that file. The default value, os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'), will store the file in your project directory.\n",

    "- __Do you know about sqlite__\n",
    "\n",
    "  - \"SQLite is an in-process library that implements a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine. The code for SQLite is in the public domain and is thus free for use for any purpose, commercial or private. SQLite is the most widely deployed database in the world with more applications than we can count, including several high-profile projects.\"\n",

    "- Also, note the __INSTALLED_APPS__ setting at the top of the file. That holds the names of all Django applications that are activated in this Django  instance. Apps can be used in multiple projects, and you can package and distribute them for use by others in their projects.\n",
    "\n",
    " By default, INSTALLED_APPS contains the following apps, all of which come with Django:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - __django.contrib.admin__ – The admin site. You’ll use it shortly.\n",
    "  - __django.contrib.auth__ – An authentication system.\n",

    "  - __django.contrib.sessions__ – A session framework.\n",
    "  - __django.contrib.messages__ – A messaging framework.\n",
    "  - __django.contrib.staticfiles__ – A framework for managing static files.\n",

    "\n",
    "  \n",
    " \n",
    " These applications are included by default as a convenience for the common case.\n",
    "\n",
    " Some of these applications make use of at least one database table, though, so we need to create the tables in the database before we can use them.   To do that, run the following command:\n",

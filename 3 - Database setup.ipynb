    "__STEPS__\n",
    "\n",
    "- We’ll setup the database .\n",
    "- Create your first model . \n",
    "- Get a quick introduction to Django’s automatically-generated admin site.\n",
    "---\n",
    "__Setup DATABASE__\n",
    "\n",
    "- Now, open up mysite/settings.py. It’s a normal Python module with module-level variables representing Django settings.\n",
    " - By default, the configuration uses SQLite. If you’re new to databases, or you’re just interested in trying Django, this is the easiest choice. SQLite is included in Python, so you won’t need to install anything else to support your database. When starting your first real project, however, you may want to use a more scalable database like PostgreSQL, to avoid database-switching headaches down the road.\n",
    " - If you wish to use another database, install the appropriate database bindings and change the following keys in the DATABASES 'default' item to match your database connection settings:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - __ENGINE__ – Either 'django.db.backends.sqlite3', 'django.db.backends.postgresql', 'django.db.backends.mysql', or 'django.db.backends.oracle'. Other backends are also available.\n",
    "     - ![settings for DB1](PICS/44.jpg)\n",
    "   - __NAME__ – The name of your database. If you’re using SQLite, the database will be a file on your computer; in that case, NAME should be the full absolute path, including filename, of that file. The default value, os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'), will store the file in your project directory.\n",
    "     - ![settings for DB2](PICS/33.jpg)\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ---\n",
    "- __Do you know about sqlite__\n",
    "\n",
    "  - \"SQLite is an in-process library that implements a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine. The code for SQLite is in the public domain and is thus free for use for any purpose, commercial or private. SQLite is the most widely deployed database in the world with more applications than we can count, including several high-profile projects.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    - ![SQLite](PICS/13.PNG)\n",
    "  ---\n",
    "  \n",
    "- If you are not using SQLite as your database, additional settings such as __USER__ , __PASSWORD__, and __HOST__ must be added.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ---\n",
    "  \n",
    "- While you’re editing **mysite/settings.py**, set __TIME_ZONE__ to your time zone and i am from Egypt so its EET .\n",

    "- Also, note the __INSTALLED_APPS__ setting at the top of the file. That holds the names of all Django applications that are activated in this Django  instance. Apps can be used in multiple projects, and you can package and distribute them for use by others in their projects.\n",
    "\n",
    " By default, INSTALLED_APPS contains the following apps, all of which come with Django:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - __django.contrib.admin__ – The admin site. You’ll use it shortly.\n",
    "  - __django.contrib.auth__ – An authentication system.\n",
    "  - __django.contrib.contenttypes__ – A framework for content types.\n",
    "  - __django.contrib.sessions__ – A session framework.\n",
    "  - __django.contrib.messages__ – A messaging framework.\n",
    "  - __django.contrib.staticfiles__ – A framework for managing static files.\n",
    "    - ![Installed Apps1](PICS/55.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    " \n",
    " These applications are included by default as a convenience for the common case.\n",
    "\n",
    " Some of these applications make use of at least one database table, though, so we need to create the tables in the database before we can use them.   To do that, run the following command:\n",

    " Don’t repeat yourself (__DRY__)¶\n",
    "Every distinct concept and/or piece of data should live in one, and only one, place. Redundancy is bad. Normalization is good.\n",

    "# Creating models¶\n",
    "\n",
    " - Now we’ll define your models – essentially, your database layout, with additional metadata.\n",
    " - ![create model](PICS/16.JPG)\n",
    " - In our simple tutorial app, we’ll create two models:__Tutorial and Topic__ .\n",
    "   - A __Tutorial__ has a name , description , a p_lang and a tutorial_logo and directory. \n",
    "   - A __Topic__ has two fields:     the topic_Title of the Topic and a file_type. Each Topic is associated with a Tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - These concepts are represented by simple Python classes. Edit the tutorial/models.py file so it looks like this:\n",
    "     - ![create model](PICS/17.JPG)\n",
    "   - The code is straightforward. Each model is represented by a class that subclasses __django.db.models.Model__. Each model has a number of class      variables, each of which represents a database field in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Each field is represented by an instance of a Field class – e.g., CharField for character fields and DateTimeField for datetimes. This tells        Django what type of data each field holds.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The name of each Field instance (e.g. title or t_date) is the field’s name, in machine-friendly format. You’ll use this value in your Python         code, and your database will use it as the column name.\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Some Field classes have required arguments. CharField, for example, requires that you give it a max_length. That’s used not only in the               database schema, but in validation, as we’ll soon see.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - A Field can also have various optional arguments; in this case, we’ve set the default value of votes to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Finally, note a relationship is defined, using __ForeignKey__. That tells Django each __Topic__ is related to a single __Tutorial__. Django          supports all         the common database relationships: many-to-one, many-to-many, and one-to-one.\n",
